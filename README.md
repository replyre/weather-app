## Weather App

### Overview

This is a weather application built with React and Ant Design that displays weather details of different cities. The application fetches weather information from an API and allows the user to interact with the data in several ways, such as retrieving weather data for predefined cities, searching for city weather data, and clicking on individual cities to fetch their weather data.
